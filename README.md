# One Piece 2048
A One Piece version of Gabriele Cirulli's [original 2048](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/). 

The original version is a small clone of [1024](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.veewo.a1024), based on [Saming's 2048](http://saming.fr/p/2048/) (also a clone).

### How did I make this
I used what I learned from Udacity's excellent mini course [Make Your Own 2048](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud248)

## License

## Donations
Gabriele made this in his spare time, and it's hosted on GitHub (which means I don't have any hosting costs), but if you enjoyed the game and feel like buying him coffee, you can donate at his BTC address: `1Ec6onfsQmoP9kkL3zkpB6c5sA4PVcXU2i`.
